        <h4><font color="#cc6699">About me!</font></h4>
        <p>
            My name is Prashanth and I reside in Moratuwa. After completing my schooling at St. Benedict's College, Kotahena, I pursued Draughtsman studies and currently work as a Technical Product Designer in a private company. 
            
            My main personal aspiration is to become a highly influential figure in my field. I have a keen interest in photography. Furthermore, I enjoy learning new languages. Over the past few years, I have acquired proficiency in the German language and even obtained CEFR B1 certification in December. Additionally, I have also learned the basics of the Korean language. 
            
            Ever since my childhood, I have had a passion for technology, and my curiosity towards programming was sparked while playing video games. I completed Harvard's CS50 and developed a few web applications to automate my tasks at the office. This experience boosted my confidence in programming, and I decided to pursue it further by enrolling in BIT. My ultimate goal is to become an innovative software developer.
