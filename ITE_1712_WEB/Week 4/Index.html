<ul>
	<li>Seagulls are very clever. They learn, remember and even pass on 
	behaviours, such as stamping their feet in a group to imitate rainfall and 
	trick earthworms to come to the surface.</li>
	<li>Seagulls’ intelligence is clearly demonstrated by a range of different 
	feeding behaviours, such as dropping hard-shelled molluscs onto rocks so 
	that they break open so they can eat them, and following ploughs in fields 
	where they know upturned grubs and other food sources will be plentiful.</li>
	<li>Seagulls are attentive and caring parents. The male and female pair for 
	life and they take turns incubating the eggs, and feeding and protecting the 
	chicks.</li>
	<li>Gulls have a complex and highly developed repertoire for communication 
	which includes a range of vocalisations and body movements.</li>
	<li>Seagulls can drink both fresh and salt water. Most animals are unable to 
	do this, but seagulls have a special pair of glands right above their eyes 
	which is specifically designed to flush the salt from their systems through 
	openings in the bill.</li>
